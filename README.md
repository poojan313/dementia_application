# dementia_application

Here we have the dementia application. It is an application for managing the patients whenever they visit the hospital to get checkup and to maintain the prescriptions and tasks assigned by the doctor.

For the backend we have used SpringBoot and Hibernate for managing MySQL database and for the frontend we have used Angular to create the necessary components. The links for the frontend and the backend are as below :

1. Frontend : https://github.com/Divyaishu31/Dementia
2. Backend : https://github.com/Akshil007/Dementia_backend

To run the application, first use the dementia.mysql from the backend to get the database into your local mysql. Then after that use IntellIJ or any other IDE and run the SpringBoot application. After that open the frontend application folder and write "npm start" to start the frontend.
